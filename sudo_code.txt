- The CLI will be like REFL
- We can say create user
- It will ask name
- It will ask age, gender, favourite color
- After done, it will give a list of items name, color, category, and price
- user can 'buy item', 'check item', 'not recommend item'.
- based on it, the recommendation buy list will be updated/sorted differently.
- new user with same age, gender or favourite color will be recommended based on previous users' choice.
